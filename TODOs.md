* how to steer left to right and top to bottom?
  * fixed layouts? e.g. 'comic' style
  * generic mindmap layout
  * or other 'fractal' layouts possible?
* goal: compact, good readable overview (embedable in document/paper)
  * always show description place (just empty)?
* is it feasible to attach a serialized outline (xml) to the svg? (for interop)
  * or also a plain text dsl (which is also nice for fast jot down of an architecture idea)
