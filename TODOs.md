* how to steer left to right and top to bottom?
  * fixed layouts? e.g. 'comic' style
  * generic mindmap layout
  * or other 'fractal' layouts possible?
* goal: compact, good readable overview (embedable in document/paper)
  * always show description place (just empty)?
* is it feasible to attach a serialized outline (xml/rdf) to the svg? (for interop) ("the truth")
  * or also a plain text dsl (which is also nice for fast jot down of an architecture idea)
  * SVG's <metadata>-Element
* maybe we need also a sequence diagram view
  * representable in the same dsl? just different visual?
* code annotations to generate a rapid overview on a system (with highlights, DRY principle using existing docs or AST)
* use source sans 3 (sans-serif, monospace)
* allow design customization/theming to follow corporate designs
