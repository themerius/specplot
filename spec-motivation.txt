[specplot]

a python library for building outline-based architecture diagrams.
the diagrams should look professional and are good readable so that they can be embedded in documentation or high stake publications like papers.

a tool for principal software architects.

[[motivation]]

why i build it:
- i was frustrated with the current options
- those options lack always something i would like
- i consider outlining as very powerful technique to think properly and build things fast
- i want something formal yet flexible (living documentation)
- fast idea visualization, a thinking tool, a documentation tool
- i like to validate architecture concepts with working code 'crystallization points', but need also a tool to present the ideas to others


[[writing a paper]]

- we have to summarize the state of the art achitecture diagrams / documentation (C4 etc.)
- we should show the best practices
- introduce the novel(?) idea here (outlining + architecture)
  - and how this fits (or enhances) into those best practices
- give some examples
- use standard svg because it's stable, wide used, open standard and produces high quality vector graphics
  - and it is good interpretable by LLMs

[[[important literature to consider]]]

- Fundamentals of Software Architecture - An Engineering Approach, by Mark Richards & Neal Ford

[[[outlook]]]

- creating a plain text dsl (bullet point based) for rapid jotting down architectures
- representation of sequence diagrams in the same fashion
- create rdf-based terminology to allow formal parseable xml's representation of architecture outline as embeddale svg-metadata (interop)
